        <p>I don't want to be boring and make a technical documentaiton page, so I am going to make this a little more interesting.</p>
        <p>Things I will be talking about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Teachers</li>
          <li>Random things that inconvenience me</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="my_internet">
        <header>my_internet</header>
        <p>My internet is laggy sometimes and not laggy other times, as many people's internet is, but my internet is sometimes superpositioned between working and not working. Kinda like this:</p>
        <code>bool BenWantsToUseInternet = true; bool InternetWorking = true;
        </code>
        <p></p>
        <code>
          while () {
            if (BenWantsToUseInternet) {
              InternetWorking = false;
            }
            if (!BenWantsToUseInternet) {
              InternetWorking = true;
            }
          }
        </code>
        <p>For some reason, my internet is terrible and barely works, this happens for about a week each month, and during the rest of the month I get around 10 ping in every game.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="my_spanish_teacher">
        <header>my_spanish_teacher</header>
        <p>My spanish teacher is very strange for a few reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any time any of my friends (only me and my friends he doesn't do this to anyone else in the class) looks slightly away from him while he is speaking he stops his teaching no matter what he is doing and says, "(name) ARE YOU STARING INTO THE LIGHTS?" Or something like that. Like this:</li>
          <p></p>
          <code>
            NumberOfDegreesMyHeadIsAwayFromMr.Tamuzian = 0;
            BenIsBored = true;
          </code>
          <p></p>
          <code>
            if (BenIsBored) {
              NumberOfDegreesMyHeadIsAwayFromMr.Tamuzian++;
            } 
          </code>
          <p></p>
          <code>
            if (NumberOfDegreesMyHeadIsAwayFromMr.Tamuzian > 15) {
              print("BEN ARE YOU OKAY, ARE YOU FALLING ASLEEP???")
            }
          </code>
          <p></p>
          <li>the class is 90% tests and quizzes and 10% homework</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>That is actually it he isn't that bad of a teacher, I am just salty that I only have an A- in the class instead of an A.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="video_games">
        <header>video_games</header>
        <p>Some people are good at video games in general, other people are only good at certain ones, and some people suck at everything. Some video games require much more mastery in order to have fun, such as apex. While in others, it is not necessary for the player to have that much skill in order to have fun, such as minecraft and fortnite</p>
        <p>Don't get me wrong, fornite is a very difficult game to master, but there are so many people who claim to be "good" that simply aren't. And idk why but skill can be deciphered from stats alone in almost every game besides fortnite. You do not know someones true skill until you play with them, and that pisses me off.</p>
        <p>I know so many guys in my grade who would claim to be "really good" and they don't even understand proper rotating technique or even when to push a fight, which is why I believe fornite is a bad game because you don't have to have a lot of knowledge of the game in order to win like you do in apex. I do have many fond memories of playing it with my friends in the game's prime though, so I do not have only hate for it.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="skoul">
        <header>skoul</header>
        <p>There are a few types of people in school:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The ones who are smart and chill</li>
          <li>The ones who are not smart and chill</li>
          <li>The ones who are smart and not chill</li>
          <li>The ones who are not smart and not chill</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I am not going to go in great depth on to what each of these mean, but someone who is chill is nice to talk to, makes you laugh, etc.. Someone who is not chill is either one of the weird kids who has no friends bc they are weird, or they are just rude or smth like that. There are also varying levels of intelligence in school:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Taking all low level classes</li>
          <li>Taking all average classes</li>
          <li>Taking mostly average and one or two high level classes</li>
          <li>Taking all high level classes</li>
          <li>Taking all high level classes and doing insane projects and stuff outside of school</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are also different levels of athleticism</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Super string bean</li>
          <li>Overweight and no athleticism</li>
          <li>String bean but strong and go gym</li>
          <li>Big and go gym</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I could go on forever about all the different kinds of people, but you get the point. Everyone is somewhere on this list, and someone isn't, it is either really good or really bad. There are so many people though who are on the low end of all of these, and I don't know how they can exist. I can not imagine not going to the gym, not trying in school, not being mentally at least 9th grader, and being bad to talk to.</p>
        <p>My grade has just under 1200 people, and I know for a fact there are at least 150 that fit the description I just made. I just do not know how you can't be good at anything, AND they don't TRY to better themselves and become good at something. And for the people that believe they are perfect in every class, "You can always be thinner, look better"-Patrick Bateman. You can always have more knowledge, there is a seemingly infinite amount of knowledge that has yet to be discovered, and the only way that other people discovered the ideas we have today is by not being satisfied, you can always be smarter.</p>
      </section>
      <p>That is it, I just wanted to write a bunch of stuff that I have been thinking down while getting this project done. I still have no idea how to do the navbar stuff though.</p>
